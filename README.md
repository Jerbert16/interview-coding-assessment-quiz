# Interview Coding Assessment Quiz

## Project Description:

It's common for employers to issue basic coding assessments to job candidates during an interview. Often times, this assessment includes both on-the-spot coding challenges and a multiple-choice quiz. As such, it's important for the candidate to be able to complete the assessment proficiently. 

This project, then, is a web-based, timed, multiple-choice, quiz built to help job-candidate-hopefuls practice for the multiple-choice section of a job interview coding assessment.
